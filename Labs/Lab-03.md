# Lab: Migrate Cassandra to Cosmos DB

## Estimated Time

90 minutes

## Scenario

In this lab, you'll migrate two datasets from Cassandra to Cosmos DB. You'll move the data in two ways. First, you'll export the data from Cassandra and use the CQLSH COPY command to import the database into Cosmos DB. Then, you'll migrate the data using Spark. You'll verify that migration was successful by running an application that queries data held in the original Cassandra database, and then reconfiguring the application to connect to Cosmos DB. The results of running the reconfigured application should remain the same.

The scenario for this lab concerns an ecommerce system. Customers can place orders for goods. The customer and order details are recorded in a Cassandra database. You have an application that generates summaries, such as the list of orders for a customer, the orders for a specific product, and various aggregations, such as the number of orders placed, and so on.

The lab runs using the Azure Cloud shell and the Azure portal.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Export the schema
* Move data using CQLSH COPY
* Move data using Spark
* Verify the migration

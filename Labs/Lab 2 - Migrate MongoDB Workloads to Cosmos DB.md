<!-- /TOC -->
In this lab, you'll take an existing MongoDB database and migrate it to Cosmos DB. You'll use the Azure Database Migration Service. You'll also see how to reconfigure existing applications that use the MongoDB database to connect to the Cosmos DB database instead.

The lab is based around an example system that captures temperature data from a series of IoT devices. The temperatures are logged in a MongoDB database, together with a timestamp. Each device has a unique ID. You will run a MongoDB application that simulates these devices, and stores the data in the database. You will also use a second application that enables a user to query statistical information about each device. After migrating the database from MongoDB to Cosmos DB, you'll configure both applications to connect to Cosmos DB, and verify that they still function correctly.

The lab runs using the Azure Cloud shell and the Azure portal.

## Exercise 1: Setup

In the first exercise, you'll create the MongoDB database for holding the data captured form the temperature devices.

6. When the Cloud Shell starts, in the drop-down list above the Cloud Shell window, select **Bash**.
7. In the Cloud Shell, enter the following command to connect to the mongodbserver virtual machine. Replace *\<ip address\>* with the value of the **mongodbserver-ip** IP address:

    ```bash
    ssh azureuser@<ip address>
    ```

8. At the prompt, type **yes** to continue connecting.
9. Enter the password **Pa55w.rdPa55w.rd**
10. Stop the MongoDB service:

    ```bash
    sudo service mongod stop
    ```

11. Start a bash shell as the **mongodb** user:

    ```bash
    sudo -u mongodb bash
    ```

12. Restart the MongoDB service locally as the **mongodb** user.

    ```bash
    mongod --dbpath /data/mongo &
    ```

    You'll see a number of messages appear on the console as the service restarts. Press enter to display the bash command prompt.

13. Run the following command to connect to the MongoDB service:

    ```bash
    mongo
    ```

14. At the **>** prompt, run the following commands. These commands create a new user named **administartor** that has administrative and monitoring rights over the database server:

    ```mongosh
    use admin
    db.createUser(
        {
            user: "administrator",
            pwd: "Pa55w.rd",
            roles: [
                { role: "userAdminAnyDatabase", db: "admin" },
                { role: "clusterMonitor", db:"admin" },
                "readWriteAnyDatabase"
            ]
        }
    )
    ```

15. Run the following commands to create another user named **deviceadmin** for a database named **DeviceData**. After running the `db.shutdownserver();` command you will receive some errors which you can ignore:

    ```mongosh
    use DeviceData;
    db.createUser(
        {
            user: "deviceadmin",
            pwd: "Pa55w.rd",
            roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "DeviceData" } ]
        }
    );
    use admin;
    db.shutdownServer();
    exit;
    ```

16. At the bash prompt, close the bash shell running as the **mongodb** user:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

17. Run the following command restart the mongodb service. Verify that the service restarts without any error messages, and is listening on port 27017:

    ```bash
    sudo service mongod start
    ```

18. Run the following command to verify that you can now log in to mongodb as the deviceadmin user:

    ```bash
    mongo -u "deviceadmin" -p "Pa55w.rd" --authenticationDatabase DeviceData
    ```

19. At the **>** prompt, run the following command to quit the mongo shell:

    ```mongosh
    exit;
    ```

20. At the bash prompt, run the following command to disconnect from the MongoDB server and return to the Cloud Shell:

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

## Exercise 2: Populate and Query the MongoDB Database

You have now created a MongoDB server and database. The next step is to demonstrate the sample applications that can populate and query the data in this database.

### Task 1: Build and Run an App to Populate the MongoDB Database

1. In the Azure Cloud Shell, run the following command to download the sample code for this workshop:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/DP-160T00A-Migrating-your-Database-to-Cosmos-DB migration-workshop-apps
    ```

2. Move to the **migration-workshop-apps/MongoDeviceDataCapture/MongoDeviceCapture** folder:

    ```bash
    cd ~/migration-workshop-apps/MongoDeviceDataCapture/MongoDeviceDataCapture
    ```

3. Use the **Code** editor to examine the **TemperatureDevice.cs** file:

    ```bash
    code TemperatureDevice.cs
    ```

    The code in this file contains a class named **TemperatureDevice** that simulates a temperatue device capturing data and saving it in a MongoDB database. It uses the MongoDB library for the .NET Framework. The  **TemperatureDevice** constructor connects to the database using settings stored in the application configuration file. The **RecordTemperatures** method generates a reading and writes it to the database.

4. Close the code editor, and then open the **ThermometerReading.cs** file:

   ```bash
   code ThermometerReading.cs
   ```

    This file shows the structure of the documents that the application stores in the database. Each document contains the following fields:

    - An object ID. The is the "_id" field generated by MongoDB to uniquely identify each document.
    - A device ID. Each device has a number with the prefix "Device ".
    - The temperature recorded by the device
    - The date and time when the temperature was recorded.
  
5. Close the code editor, and then open the **App.config** file:

    ```bash
    code App.config
    ```

    This file contains the settings for connecting to the MongoDB database. Set the value for the **Address** key to the IP address of the MongoDB server that you recorded earlier, and then save the file and close the editor.

6. Run the following command to rebuild the application:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    ````

7. Run the application:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    The application simulates 100 devices running simultaneously. Allow the application to run for a couple of minutes, and then press Enter to stop it.

### Task 2: Build and Run Another App to Query the MongoDB Database

1. Move to the **migration-workshop-apps/MongoDeviceDataCapture/DeviceDataQuery** folder:

    ```bash
    cd ~/migration-workshop-apps/MongoDeviceDataCapture/DeviceDataQuery
    ```

    This folder contains another application that you can use to analyze the data captured by each device.

2. Use the **Code** editor to examine the **Program.cs** file:

    ```bash
    code Program.cs
    ```

    The application connects to the database (using the **ConnectToDatabase** method at at te bottom of the file and then prompts the user for a device number. The application uses the MongoDB library for the .NET Framework to create and run an aggregate pipeline that calculates the following statistics for the specified device:

    - The number of readings recorded.
    - The average temperature recorded.
    - The lowest reading.
    - The highest reading.
    - The latest reading.

3. Close the code editor, and then open the **App.config** file:

    ```bash
    code App.config
    ```

    As before, set the value for the **Address** key to the IP address of the MongoDB server that you recorded earlier, and then save the file and close the editor.

4. Build and run the application:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```

5. At the **Enter Device Number** prompt, enter a value between 0 and 99. The application will query the database, calculate the statistics, and display the results. Press **Q** to quit the application.

## Exercise 3: Migrate the MongoDB Database to Cosmos DB

The next step is to take the MongoDB database and transfer it to Cosmos DB.

### Task 1: Create a Cosmos Account and Database

1. Return to the Azure portal.
2. In the hamburger menu, click **+ Create a resource**.
3. On the **New** page, in the **Search the Marketplace** box, type ***Azure Cosmos DB**, end then press Enter.

3. Return to the Cloud Shell window (reconnect if the session has timed out), and move to the **migration-workshop-apps/MongoDeviceDataCapture/DeviceDataQuery** folder:

    ```bash
    cd ~/migration-workshop-apps/MongoDeviceDataCapture/DeviceDataQuery
    ```

4. Open the App.config file in the Code editor:

    ```bash
    code App.config
    ```

5. In the **Settings for MongoDB** section of the file, comment out the existing settings.
6. Uncomment the settings in the **Settings for Cosmos DB Mongo API** section, and set the values for these settings as follows:

    | Setting  | Value  |
    |---|---|
    | Address | The **Host** from the **mongodb*nnn* Connection String** page |
    | Username | The **Username** from the **mongodb*nnn* Connection String** page |
    | Password | The **Primary Password** from the **mongodb*nnn* Connection String** page |

    The completed file should look similar to this:

    ```XML
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <configuration>
        <appSettings>
            <add key="Database" value="DeviceData" />
            <add key="Collection" value="Temperatures" />

            <!-- Settings for MongoDB -->
            <!--add key="Address" value="nn.nn.nn.nn" />
            <add key="Port" value="27017" />
            <add key="Username" value="deviceadmin" />
            <add key="Password" value="Pa55w.rd" /-->
            <!-- End of settings for MongoDB -->

            <!-- Settings for CosmosDB Mongo API -->
            <add key="Address" value="mongodbnnn.documents.azure.com"/>
            <add key="Port" value="10255"/>
            <add key="Username" value="mongodbnnn"/>
            <add key="Password" value="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx=="/>
            <!-- End of settings for CosmosDB Mongo API -->
        </appSettings>
    </configuration>
    ```

7. Save the file, and then close the Code editor.

8. Open the Program.cs file using the Code editor:

    ```bash
    code Program.cs
    ```

9. Scroll down to the **ConnectToDatabase** method.
10. Comment out the line that sets the credentials for connecting to MongoDB, and uncomment the statements that specify the credentials for connecting to Cosmos DB. The code should look like this:

    ```C#
    // Connect to the MongoDB database
    MongoClient client = new MongoClient(new MongoClientSettings
    {
        Server = new MongoServerAddress(address, port),
        ServerSelectionTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10),

        //
        // Credential settings for MongoDB
        //

        // Credential = MongoCredential.CreateCredential(database, azureLogin.UserName, azureLogin.SecurePassword),

        //
        // Credential settings for CosmosDB Mongo API
        //

        UseSsl = true,
        SslSettings = new SslSettings
        {
            EnabledSslProtocols = SslProtocols.Tls12
        },
        Credential = new MongoCredential("SCRAM-SHA-1", new MongoInternalIdentity(database, azureLogin.UserName), new PasswordEvidence(azureLogin.SecurePassword))

        // End of Mongo API settings 
    });

    ```

    These changes are necessary because the original MongoDB database was not using an SSL connection. Cosmos DB always uses SSL.

11. Save the file, and then close the Code editor.
12. Rebuild and run the application:

    ```bash
    dotnet build
    dotnet run
    ```

13. At the **Enter Device Number** prompt, enter a device number between 0 and 99. The application should run exactly as before, except this time it is using the data held in the Cosmos DB database.
14. Test the application with other device numbers. Enter **Q** to finish.

You have successfully migrated a MongoDB database to Cosmos DB, and reconfigured an existing MongoDB application to connect to the Cosmos DB database.

## Exercise 5: Clean Up
